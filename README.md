# VHDocL

VHDocL is a structural documentation tool for the hardware description language
VHDL, similar to doxygen, javadoc and others for software languages.  It
documents packages and package bodies; entities with their ports and generics;
architectures and their instantiations, processes and generate statements; and
much more.  It outputs interlinked HTML pages of entity and package lists, the
instantiation hierarchy, all design elements (entities, packages, ...) and
source files converted to HTML with syntax markup.

The upstream repository of VHDocL is not hosted on github, but on the author's
web site: <http://volkerschatz.com/hardware/vhdocl.html>.  Volker is
old-fashioned and believes git is a distributed RCS that works quite well
without a hub.  But he wrote this README.md as a template for folks who want to
store a branch on github.


# This fork

To aid the unwary, fork developers should probably put some or all of the
following information here:

* what is the topic / development aim of this fork?
* what is its scope? (private patches; destined for upstream; diverging fork)
* development status (experimental; stable; merged upstream)
* documentation of added features / modifications

If you read this on github unmodified, you know the fork author is sloppy with
documentation.  :-P
